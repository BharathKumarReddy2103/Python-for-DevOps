**Automating AWS Resource Management with Boto3 and Python: A DevOps Engineer's Guide**

**Introduction**

AWS automation is a crucial skill for **DevOps Engineers** and **Cloud Engineers**. Managing cloud resources efficiently not only saves time but also helps in **cost optimization**. One of the most powerful tools for automating AWS operations using Python is **Boto3**.

In this guide, we will cover:

‚Ä¢	What is **Boto3?**

‚Ä¢	Why DevOps Engineers should use **Boto3** instead of AWS CLI, Terraform, or CloudFormation

‚Ä¢	Hands-on example: **Creating an S3 bucket with Boto3**

‚Ä¢	Real-world use case: **Automating Cloud Cost Optimization with Lambda and Boto3**

‚Ä¢	Best practices for using **Boto3 in DevOps automation**

By the end of this article, you will have a clear understanding of how **Boto3** helps in AWS automation and how DevOps engineers can leverage it for real-world tasks.

**What is Boto3?**

**Boto3** is the **Python SDK for AWS**, allowing developers and DevOps engineers to interact with AWS services programmatically. If you want to:

**‚Ä¢	Create AWS resources** (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions)

**‚Ä¢	Monitor cloud infrastructure**

**‚Ä¢	Automate cloud cost optimization**

**‚Ä¢	Manage IAM users and security policies**

Then **Boto3** is your go-to library.

**Why Use Boto3 Over Other AWS Tools?**

| **Tool**           | **Best Use Case**                                     | **Scripting Required?** |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **AWS CLI**       | Quick, one-time operations                            | ‚úÖ Yes                  |
| **Boto3 (Python SDK)** | Automation, AWS API interactions, scripting      | ‚úÖ Yes                  |
| **Terraform / CloudFormation** | Infrastructure as Code (IaC), provisioning | ‚ùå No                   |

While **Terraform and CloudFormation** are great for **defining infrastructure as code, Boto3** is essential when:

‚Ä¢	You need **automation scripts** for AWS management.

‚Ä¢	You are working with **serverless computing (AWS Lambda).**

‚Ä¢	You need **fine-grained control over AWS API interactions.**

---

**Prerequisites for Using Boto3**

Before working with **Boto3**, ensure:

**1.**	You have **AWS CLI installed** and configured (aws configure).

**2.**	You have **Python 3+ installed.**

**3.**	You have the **Boto3 library installed:**

```sh
pip install boto3
```

**4.**	You have **IAM access keys** with the right permissions to interact with AWS.

**Hands-On: Creating an S3 Bucket Using Boto3**

Let's get started with a simple **Python script** to create an S3 bucket using **Boto3.**

**Step 1: Install and Import Boto3**

```sh
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
```

**Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket**

```sh
bucket_name = "my-demo-bucket-boto3"
region = "us-east-1"

# Create a new S3 bucket
response = s3_client.create_bucket(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': region}
)

print(f"Bucket {bucket_name} created successfully.")
```

**Note:** AWS enforces **unique S3 bucket names**, so change "my-demo-bucket-boto3" to something unique.

**Step 3: Verify the Bucket**

To verify that the bucket has been created, run:

```sh
aws s3 ls
```
or check in the **AWS Console** under S3.

**Advanced Use Case: Automating AWS Cloud Cost Optimization**

One of the most important responsibilities of a **DevOps Engineer** is **Cloud Cost Optimization**. AWS resources, if left unattended, can **accumulate high costs**. A common scenario is **unused EBS snapshots** consuming storage unnecessarily.

**Problem Statement**

‚Ä¢	Developers create **EBS snapshots** regularly as backups.

‚Ä¢	Over time, many snapshots become **orphaned** (not attached to any EC2 instance).

‚Ä¢	These orphaned snapshots increase **AWS storage costs.**

‚Ä¢	DevOps engineers need a solution to **automatically delete stale snapshots.**

**Solution: AWS Lambda + Boto3**

We will create an **AWS Lambda function** that:

**1.	Identifies stale EBS snapshots.**

**2.	Deletes orphaned snapshots to save costs.**

**3.	Runs automatically every day via CloudWatch Events.**

---

**Step 1: Python Code for AWS Lambda**

```sh
import boto3

# Initialize EC2 client
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """ Deletes unused EBS snapshots to reduce AWS costs. """
    
    # Get all EBS snapshots
    snapshots = ec2_client.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
    
    for snapshot in snapshots:
        snapshot_id = snapshot['SnapshotId']
        volume_id = snapshot.get('VolumeId', None)
        
        if not volume_id:
            print(f"Deleting orphaned snapshot: {snapshot_id}")
            ec2_client.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
    
    return {"status": "completed"}
```

**Step 2: Deploying the Lambda Function**

1.	Create a **Lambda function** in AWS.
  
2.	Choose **Python 3.x** as the runtime.
  
3.	Paste the above Python code into the function editor.

4.	Assign IAM permissions for:

   o	ec2:DescribeSnapshots

   o	ec2:DeleteSnapshot

5.	Save and deploy the function.

**Step 3: Automating with CloudWatch**

**1.**	Open **AWS CloudWatch.**

**2.**	Create a **new EventBridge Rule.**

**3.**	Choose S**chedule Expression (cron job).**

**4.**	Set it to run **every 24 hours.**

5.	Attach the Lambda function.

**Best Practices for Using Boto3 in DevOps**

**1. Always Use IAM Roles Instead of Access Keys**

Instead of storing AWS **access keys in your scripts**, use **IAM roles** for authentication.

**2. Handle API Errors Gracefully**

Always use **try-except** blocks to handle AWS errors.

```sh
try:
    ec2_client.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error deleting snapshot {snapshot_id}: {e}")
```

**3. Use Logging for Debugging**

Use AWS **CloudWatch logs** to monitor Lambda execution.

```sh
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger()

logger.info("EBS snapshot cleanup script started.")
```

**4. Optimize API Calls**

Avoid unnecessary API calls by **filtering data upfront.**

```sh
snapshots = ec2_client.describe_snapshots(
    Filters=[{'Name': 'status', 'Values': ['completed']}],
    OwnerIds=['self']
)['Snapshots']
```
